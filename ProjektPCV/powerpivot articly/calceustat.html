                                define few

                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>We will use two files created in other articles. The first one is the flat EU NUTS hierarchy
                            (link), and
                            the second one containing data is the basic EU LAU statistics, created here (link).</p>
                        <h2>1 Creating Data Model</h2>
                        <p>First, open a new Excel workbook and load both queries we created before. The easiest way is
                            to
                            export both connection files from the original workbooks and load them into separate sheets
                            of the
                            new workbook. This is done via Data =&gt; Existing connections. You can also copy the lists
                            of the
                            original workbook into the new one.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Load both files into tables and rename them to “NUTS” and “Data”.</li>
                            <li>Click into the first table, go to PowerPivot =&gt; Add to Data Model</li>
                            <li>Repeat for the second table</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should have now both tables in the PowerPivot window:</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C01.JPG" alt=""> </p>
                        <p>Next, you need to define a relationship between the two tables so that every row of the Data
                            table
                            can find the corresponding row in the NUTS table with regional description of the row. Click
                            on
                            Diagram View and drag the NUTSCodeLevel3 field of the Data table on top of NUTSCodeLevel3
                            field
                            in the NUTS table.</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs /C02.JPG" alt=""> </p>
                        <p>Let go the mouse button and the relationship is created. The arrow tells you that the
                            filtering will run
                            from the NUTS table to the data table, that is, by filtering the regions you will be
                            actually filtering also
                            the data table.</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C03.JPG" alt=""> </p>
                        <p>The relationship is one-to-many, that means that every row in the data table corresponds to
                            one and
                            only one row in the lookup table with the regions.</p>
                        <p>You can close the PowerPivot window now and insert a new blank worksheet if needed.</p>
                        <h2>2 Creating measures</h2>
                        <p>Now, let’s create our first pivot table based on PowerPivot data model. First, insert a blank
                            pivot
                            table into the worksheet and choose “Use external Data Source” and This Workbook Data Model
                            as
                            data source.</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C04.JPG" alt=""> </p>
                        <p>Next, drag the Country field of the NUTS table into the Rows box:</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C05.JPG" alt=""> </p>
                        <p>Now we will add our first measure, which is a name the PowerPivot uses for the formulae
                            written in
                            its specific language, DAX. DAX looks similar to Excel formulae, but it is very different
                            and much more
                            powerful. You can imagine it being a mixture of SQL and Excel, because one formula can
                            perform
                            filtering and calculation in the same time. Moreover, every DAX formula always takes the
                            filter and
                            row context into consideration simultaneously. The filter context comes from any filter that
                            applies
                            to any particular cell of the pivot table, no matter if it comes from slicer, row header,
                            column header,
                            filter, etc. The row context is more hidden but it is related to the fact that the data
                            model always
                            consists of tables with rows, called also records in database world. So for example if we
                            write a DAX
                            formula that iterates across all the rows, one by one, at each evaluation step the row
                            context is
                            present. Detailed explanation is beyond scope of this article.</p>
                        <p>The first simple measure that we create will return the sum of population:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Click on Power Pivot tab, click Measure =&gt; New measure.</li>
                            <li>Fill the dialog like this:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C06.JPG" alt=""> </p>
                        <p><b><em>Table Name</em></b>: Select the Data table. It has no impact on calculation but it
                            tells the engine which table
                            the measure is associated with. You see the measure then as additional field of this table
                            in the Pivot
                            table Fields pane.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Measure Name</em></b>: Any name that does not exist in the model yet (not even as a
                            column name of the
                            underlying model).</p>
                        <p><b><em>Description</em></b>: optionally describe what the measure is intended to do.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Formula</em></b>: Enter the formula in DAX syntax. You can click Check formula to
                            verify syntax.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Formatting Options</em></b>: This is very useful dialog part, because once you
                            associate format with the
                            measure, it will always be applied automatically.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Click OK to create the measure and get this result:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C07.JPG" alt=""></p>
                        <p>Several things happened. First of all, the list of countries got substantially shorter. This
                            is because
                            DAX has a built-in feature called Autoexist, which automatically hides the filters which do
                            not contain
                            any data (remember that when we created the sample query, we selected only few countries?).
                        </p>
                        <p>Second, there is a mysterious country called “(blank)”. These are summed rows of the Data
                            table,
                            that do not have any counterpart in the NUTS table. We can find why this happened when we
                            display
                            also the region codes from the Data table. Drag the NUTSCodeLevel3 of Data table into the
                            Rows
                            box, and collapse all fields except “(Blank)”:</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C08.JPG" alt=""></p>
                        <p>How this happened? It is very simple. The classification of NUTS in EU develops with time and
                            so
                            some regions were merged in the last version and got new code, which can’t be found in the
                            data
                            table. In real world, one must either to consolidate the data in the data table or adjust
                            the lookup
                            table accordingly to ensure data integrity. In fact, it turns out that preparation of
                            consistent data
                            model usually takes 80% of the time, 15% takes coding of the DAX measures, and only 5% is
                            the
                            cherries, that is, what the user really sees.</p>
                        <p>Cautious reader may recall that in the data query, we selected also Cyprus, but is missing in
                            the table.
                            Why? Because the data table for Cyprus did not contain any data about population.</p>
                        <p>For our purpose in order to “clean” the report, we click on the filter arrow next to “Row
                            labels” and
                            unselect “(blank)”. It will have no serious impact on the demonstration.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Now, let’s create a second measure – Total Area in km2.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C09.JPG" alt=""></p>
                        <p>And we get this result:</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C10.JPG" alt=""></p>
                        <p>You see that Cyprus now appeared on the list. This because while Data has no data for
                            population, it
                            however contains data for area. That’s why Autoexist returned the Cyprus filter back to the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Finally, let’s use the created measures and calculate density per km2. The formula is</p>
                        <p><mark>Density:=DIVIDE([Total Population];[Total Area (km2)])</mark>
                        </p>
                        <p>We get the following result:</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C11.JPG" alt=""></p>
                        <p>You can notice two things. First, there is no result for Cyprus, because the DIVIDE() formula
                            automatically handled the division by zero error as blank (you can define another error
                            output if you
                            want).</p>
                        <p>Second, if you examine the Grand Total row, you can find out that the total density of
                            selected
                            countries is calculated as total population divided by total area, but Cyprus is missing in
                            the total
                            area. How to handle this depends on the business logic of your report. For example, you can
                            decide
                            that the grand total row should be calculated excluding Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Without any deep explanation, this is the formula handling the total row differently from the
                            detail
                            rows:</p>
                        <p><mark>Density Handled:</mark></p>
                        <p><mark> =if(</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>           HASONEVALUE(NUTS[Country]);</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>                 [Density];</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>                 DIVIDE([Total Population];</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>                       CALCULATE([Total Area (km2)];NUTS[CountryCode]&lt;&gt;&quot;CY&quot;)</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>                       )</mark></p>
                        <p><mark>           )</mark></p>

                        <p>The HASONEVALUE function decides if we are in the grand total row (False). In that case, it
                            triggers
                            CALCULATE() function in the denominator of the DIVIDE() function which modifies the filter
                            to
                            exclude Cyprus from the Total Area calculation. That is why for grand total, we get slightly
                            different result. The difference is of course small due to relatively small influence of Cyprus area on the total
                            result:</p>
                        <p><img src="../calceustat imgs/C12.JPG" alt=""></p>
                        <p>This is only a small example, but it shows how powerful DAX engine is compared to simple Excel pivot
                                table calculated fields.</p>
